<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> cruiser vanished back
into hyperspace and he
was alone in the observation
bubble, ten thousand light-years
beyond the galaxy's
outermost sun. He looked out
the windows at the gigantic
sea of emptiness around him
and wondered again what the
danger had been that had so
terrified the men before him.</p>

<p>Of one thing he was already
certain; he would find
that nothing was waiting
outside the bubble to kill him.
The first bubble attendant
had committed suicide and
the second was a mindless
maniac on the Earthbound
cruiser but it must have been
something inside the bubble
that had caused it. Or else
they had imagined it all.</p>

<p>He went across the small
room, his magnetized soles
loud on the thin metal floor
in the bubble's silence. He sat
down in the single chair, his
weight very slight in the
feeble artificial gravity, and
reviewed the known facts.</p>

<p>The bubble was a project
of Earth's Galactic Observation
Bureau, positioned there
to gather data from observations
that could not be made
from within the galaxy.
Since metallic mass affected
the hypersensitive instruments
the bubble had been
made as small and light as
possible. It was for that reason
that it could accommodate
only one attendant.</p>

<p>The Bureau had selected
Horne as the bubble's first
attendant and the cruiser
left him there for his six
months' period of duty. When
it made its scheduled return
with his replacement he was
found dead from a tremendous
overdose of sleeping
pills. On the table was his
daily-report log and his last
entry, made three months
before:</p>

<p><i>I haven't attended to the
instruments for a long time
because it hates us and
doesn't want us here. It hates
me the most of all and keeps
trying to get into the bubble
to kill me. I can hear it whenever
I stop and listen and I
know it won't be long. I'm
afraid of it and I want to be
asleep when it comes. But I'll
have to make it soon because
I have only twenty sleeping
pills left and if&mdash;</i></p>

<p>The sentence was never
finished. According to the
temperature recording instruments
in the bubble his
body ceased radiating heat
that same night.</p>

<hr />

<p>The bubble was cleaned,
fumigated, and inspected inside
and out. No sign of any
inimical entity or force could
be found.</p>

<p>Silverman was Horne's replacement.
When the cruiser
returned six months later
bringing him, Green, to be
Silverman's replacement, Silverman
was completely insane.
He babbled about something
that had been waiting
outside the bubble to kill
him but his nearest to a rational
statement was to say
once, when asked for the
hundredth time what he had
seen:</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;you can't really
see it. But you feel it watching
you and you hear it trying
to get in to kill you. One
time I bumped the wall and&mdash;for
God's sake&mdash;take me
away from it&mdash;take me back
to Earth ..."</p>

<p>Then he had tried to hide
under the captain's desk and
the ship's doctor had led him
away.</p>

<p>The bubble was minutely
examined again and the
cruiser employed every detector
device it possessed to
search surrounding space for
light-years in all directions.
Nothing was found.</p>

<p>When it was time for the
new replacement to be transferred
to the bubble he reported
to Captain McDowell.</p>

<p>"Everything is ready,
Green," McDowell said. "You
are the next one." His shaggy
gray eyebrows met in a
scowl. "It would be better if
they would let me select the
replacement instead of
them."</p>

<p>He flushed with a touch of
resentment and said, "The
Bureau found my intelligence
and initiative of thought satisfactory."</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;the characteristics
you don't need. What
they ought to have is somebody
like one of my engine
room roustabouts, too ignorant
to get scared and too
dumb to go nuts. Then we
could get a sane report six
months from now instead of
the ravings of a maniac."</p>

<p>"I suggest," he said stiffly,
"that you reserve judgement
until that time comes, sir."</p>

<hr />

<p>And that was all he knew
about the danger, real or
imaginary, that had driven
two men into insanity. He
would have six months in
which to find the answer. Six
months minus&mdash; He looked at
the chronometer and saw
that twenty minutes had
passed since he left the cruiser.
Somehow, it seemed much
longer ...</p>

<p>He moved to light a cigarette
and his metal soles
scraped the floor with the
same startling loudness he
had noticed before. The bubble
was as silent as a tomb.</p>

<p>It was not much larger
than a tomb; a sphere eighteen
feet in diameter, made
of thin sheet steel and criss-crossed
outside with narrow
reinforcing girders to keep
the internal air pressure
from rupturing it. The floor
under him was six feet up
from the sphere's bottom and
the space beneath held the air
regenerator and waste converter
units, the storage batteries
and the food cabinets.
The compartment in which
he sat contained chair, table,
a narrow cot, banks of dials,
a remote-control panel for
operating the instruments
mounted outside the hull, a
microfilm projector, and a
pair of exerciser springs attached
to one wall. That was
all.</p>

<p>There was no means of
communication since a hyperspace
communicator would
have affected the delicate instruments
with its radiations
but there was a small microfilm
library to go with the
projector so that he should
be able to pass away the time
pleasantly enough.</p>

<p>But it was not the fear of
boredom that was behind the
apprehension he could already
feel touching at his
mind. It had not been boredom
that had turned Horne
into a suicide and Silverman
into&mdash;</p>

<p>Something cracked sharply
behind him, like a gunshot
in the stillness, and he leaped
to his feet, whirling to face
it.</p>

<p>It was only a metal reel of
data tape that had dropped
out of the spectrum analyzer
into the storage tray.</p>

<p>His heart was thumping
fast and his attempt to laugh
at his nervousness sounded
hollow and mirthless. <i>Something</i>
inside or outside the
bubble had driven two men
insane with its threat and
now that he was irrevocably
exiled in the bubble, himself,
he could no longer dismiss
their fear as products of
their imagination. Both of
them had been rational, intelligent
men, as carefully selected
by the Observation
Bureau as he had been.</p>

<p>He set in to search the
bubble, overlooking nothing.
When he crawled down into
the lower compartment he
hesitated then opened the
longest blade of his knife before
searching among the
dark recesses down there. He
found nothing, not even a
speck of dust.</p>

<p>Back in his chair again he
began to doubt his first conviction.
Perhaps there really
had been some kind of an
invisible force or entity outside
the bubble. Both Horne
and Silverman had said that
"it" had tried to get in to kill
them.</p>

<p>They had been very definite
about that part.</p>

<hr />

<p>There were six windows
around the bubble's walls, set
there to enable the attendant
to see all the outside-mounted
instruments and dials. He
went to them to look out, one
by one, and from all of them
he saw the same vast emptiness
that surrounded him.
The galaxy&mdash;his galaxy&mdash;was
so far away that its
stars were like dust. In the
other directions the empty
gulf was so wide that galaxies
and clusters of galaxies
were tiny, feeble specks of
light shining across it.</p>

<p>All around him was a void
so huge that galaxies were
only specks in it....</p>

<p>Who could know what
forces or dangers might be
waiting out there?</p>

<p>A light blinked, reminding
him it was time to attend to
his duties. The job required
an hour and he was nervous
and not yet hungry when he
had finished. He went to the
exerciser springs on the wall
and performed a work-out
that left him tired and sweating
but which, at least, gave
him a small appetite.</p>

<p>The day passed, and the
next. He made another
search of the bubble's interior
with the same results as
before. He felt almost sure,
then, that there was nothing
in the bubble with him.
He established a routine of
work, pastime and sleep that
made the first week pass fairly
comfortably but for the
gnawing worry in his mind
that something invisible was
lurking just outside the windows.</p>

<p>Then one day he accidentally
kicked the wall with his
metal shoe tip.</p>

<p>It made a sound like that
from kicking a tight-stretched
section of tin and it seemed
to him it gave a little from
the impact, as tin would do.
He realized for the first time
how thin it was&mdash;how deadly,
dangerously thin.</p>

<p>According to the specifications
he had read it was only
one-sixteenth of an inch
thick. It was as thin as cardboard.</p>

<p>He sat down with pencil
and paper and began calculating.
The bubble had a surface
area of 146,500 square
inches and the internal air
pressure was fourteen
pounds to the square inch.
Which meant that the thin
metal skin contained a total
pressure of 2,051,000 pounds.</p>

<p>Two million pounds.</p>

<p>The bubble in which he sat
was a bomb, waiting to explode
the instant any section
of the thin metal weakened.</p>

<p>It was supposed to be an
alloy so extremely strong
that it had a high safety factor
but he could not believe
that any metal so thin could
be so strong. It was all right
for engineers sitting safely
on Earth to speak of high
safety factors but his life depended
upon the fragile wall
not cracking. It made a lot of
difference.</p>

<hr />

<p>The next day he thought
he felt the hook to which the
exerciser spring was attached
crack loose from where it
was welded to the wall. He
inspected the base of the
hook closely and there seemed
to be a fine, hairline fracture
appearing around it.</p>

<hr />

<p>He held his ear to it, listening
for any sound of a leak.
It was not leaking yet but it
could commence doing so at
any time. He looked out the
windows at the illimitable
void that was waiting to absorb
his pitiful little supply
of air and he thought of the
days he had hauled and jerked
at the springs with all his
strength, not realizing the
damage he was doing.</p>

<p>There was a sick feeling
in his stomach for the rest
of the day and he returned
again and again to examine
the hairline around the hook.</p>

<p>The next day he discovered
an even more serious threat:
the thin skin of the bubble
had been spot-welded to the
outside reinforcing girders.</p>

<p>Such welding often created
hard, brittle spots that would
soon crystallize from continued
movement&mdash;and there
was a slight temperature difference
in the bubble between
his working and sleeping
hours that would daily produce
a contraction and expansion
of the skin. Especially
when he used the little
cooking burner.</p>

<p>He quit using the burner
for any purpose and began
a daily inspection of every
square inch of the bubble's
walls, marking with white
chalk all the welding spots
that appeared to be definitely
weakened. Each day he found
more to mark and soon the
little white circles were scattered
across the walls wherever
he looked.</p>

<p>When he was not working
at examining the walls he
could feel the windows watching
him, like staring eyes.
Out of self defense he would
have to go to them and stare
back at the emptiness.</p>

<p>Space was alien; coldly,
deadly, alien. He was a tiny
spark of life in a hostile sea
of Nothing and there was no
one to help him. The Nothing
outside was waiting day and
night for the most infinitesimal
leak or crack in the walls;
the Nothing that had been
waiting out there since time
without beginning and would
wait for time without end.</p>

<p>Sometimes he would touch
his finger to the wall and
think, <i>Death is out there, only
one-sixteenth of an inch away</i>.
His first fears became a black
and terrible conviction: the
bubble could not continue to
resist the attack for long. It
had already lasted longer than
it should have. Two million
pounds of pressure wanted out
and all the sucking Nothing
of intergalactic space wanted
in. And only a thin skin of
metal, rotten with brittle
welding spots, stood between
them.</p>

<p>It wanted in&mdash;the Nothing
wanted in. He knew, then,
that Horne and Silverman
had not been insane. It wanted
in and someday it would
get in. When it did it would
explode him and jerk out his
guts and lungs. Not until that
happened, not until the Nothing
filled the bubble and enclosed
his hideous, turned-inside-out
body would it ever be
content ...</p>

<hr />

<p>He had long since quit
wearing the magnetized shoes,
afraid the vibration of them
would weaken the bubble still
more. And he began noticing
sections where the bubble did
not seem to be perfectly concave,
as though the rolling
mill had pressed the metal too
thin in places and it was
swelling out like an over-inflated
balloon.</p>

<p>He could not remember
when he had last attended to
the instruments. Nothing was
important but the danger that
surrounded him. He knew the
danger was rapidly increasing
because whenever he pressed
his ear to the wall he could
hear the almost inaudible
tickings and vibrations as the
bubble's skin contracted or expanded
and the Nothing tapped
and searched with its
empty fingers for a flaw or
crack that it could tear into a
leak.</p>

<p>But the windows were far
the worst, with the Nothing
staring in at him day and
night. There was no escape
from it. He could feel it
watching him, malignant and
gloating, even when he hid his
eyes in his hands.</p>

<p>The time came when he
could stand it no longer. The
cot had a blanket and he used
that together with all his
spare clothes to make a tent
stretching from the table to
the first instrument panel.
When he crawled under it he
found that the lower half of
one window could still see
him. He used the clothes he
was wearing to finish the job
and it was much better then,
hiding there in the concealing
darkness where the Nothing
could not see him.</p>

<p>He did not mind going
naked&mdash;the temperature regulators
in the bubble never let
it get too cold.</p>

<p>He had no conception of
time from then on. He emerged
only when necessary to
bring more food into his tent.
He could still hear the Nothing
tapping and sucking in its
ceaseless search for a flaw and
he made such emergences as
brief as possible, wishing that
he did not have to come out
at all. Maybe if he could hide
in his tent for a long time and
never make a sound it would
get tired and go away ...</p>

<p>Sometimes he thought of the
cruiser and wished they would
come for him but most of the
time he thought of the thing
that was outside, trying to get
in to kill him. When the strain
became too great he would
draw himself up in the position
he had once occupied in
his mother's womb and pretend
he had never left Earth.
It was easier there.</p>

<p>But always, before very
long, the bubble would tick or
whisper and he would freeze
in terror, thinking, <i>This time
it's coming in ...</i></p>

<hr />

<p>Then one day, suddenly,
two men were peering under
his tent at him.</p>

<p>One of them said, "My God&mdash;<i>again!</i>"
and he wondered
what he meant. But they were
very nice to him and helped
him put on his clothes. Later,
in the cruiser, everything was
hazy and they kept asking
him what he was afraid of.</p>

<p>"What was it&mdash;what did
you find?"</p>

<p>He tried hard to think so
he could explain it. "It was&mdash;it
was Nothing."</p>

<p>"What were you and Horne
and Silverman afraid of&mdash;what
was it?" the voice demanded
insistently.</p>

<p>"I told you," he said.
"Nothing."</p>

<p>They stared at him and the
haziness cleared a little as he
saw they did not understand.
He wanted them to believe
him because what he told
them was so very true.</p>

<p>"It wanted to kill us. Please&mdash;can't
you believe me? It was
waiting outside the bubble to
kill us."</p>

<p>But they kept staring and
he knew they didn't believe
him. They didn't <i>want</i> to believe
him ...</p>

<p>Everything turned hazy
again and he started to cry.
He was glad when the doctor
took his hand to lead him
away ...</p>

<p>The bubble was carefully
inspected, inside and out, and
nothing was found. When it
was time for Green's replacement
to be transferred to it
Larkin reported to Captain
McDowell.</p>

<p>"Everything is ready, Larkin,"
McDowell said. "You're
the next one. I wish we knew
what the danger is." He
scowled. "I still think one of
my roustabouts from the engine
room might give us a
sane report six months from
now instead of the babblings
we'll get from you."</p>

<p>He felt his face flush and
he said stiffly, "I suggest, sir,
that you not jump to conclusions
until that time comes."</p>

<hr />

<p>The cruiser vanished back
into hyperspace and he was
alone inside the observation
bubble, ten thousand light-years
beyond the galaxy's outermost
sun. He looked out the
windows at the gigantic sea
of emptiness around him and
wondered again what the danger
had been that had so terrified
the men before him.</p>

<p>Of one thing he was already
certain; he would find
that nothing was waiting
outside the bubble to kill
him ...</p>
